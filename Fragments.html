            Lecture hall buzzed with anticipation as I settled into my seat, my eyes fixed on a man who seemed to embody the qualities of Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy himself. Intelligent, generous, and unwaveringly honest, he commanded attention effortlessly. As my pupils shifted to catch a glimpse of him, I couldn't help but imagine myself as Elizabeth Bennet, longing for a connection with this captivating figure.
                Yet, insecurities crept into my mind, fueled by the presence of other girls who also admired him. The weight of my hidden insecurities tormented me, and the sudden desire to be wanted to consume my thoughts. The advice my mother had imparted seemed distant as I yearned for him, if only for a small part of him. Throughout the lecture, I watched him struggle to answer questions posed by the lecturer, and oddly enough, his failures only intensified my attraction. Questions plagued my mind: Was I broken? Was something wrong with me?
                Lost in my thoughts, I was abruptly interrupted by an accidental encounter after class. This unexpected intrusion gave me the chance to gather my courage and speak to him. However, as I approached, I witnessed a horde of girls swarming around him, making me hesitate once more. I returned to my hostel, lying on my bed, where privacy was a luxury. Dreaming of what could have been, I couldn't help but question myself—why didn't I seize the opportunity to talk to him?
                Like clockwork, I called him that evening, hoping he wouldn't answer.</p>
             </div>
               <div class="container"><p class="listing"> I waited anxiously, contemplating what to say if he did pick up. However, my hopes were dashed as the beeping of the unanswered call filled the air. Determined, I dialled his number again, sitting outside my hostel amidst a swarm of mosquitoes, waiting for him to respond. Finally, a voice on the other end answered, causing a mix of relief and anxiety to wash over me. We talked and laughed into the night, interrupted only by the relentless mosquito bites. I went to bed that night with a smile, thinking of ways to impress him.
                We talked for hours, but on campus, he still seemed to ignore me. Deep down, I knew he didn't reciprocate my feelings, but a small fragment within me hoped that he would come around. Days turned into weeks, and finally, I gathered the courage to confess my feelings through a text message: "I fancy you." His response left me taken aback, and my chest grew heavy. I lay down, contemplating what to say next, but unexpectedly burst into laughter. I had finally received an answer, and now I struggled to find a path forward.
                Days turned into weeks, and there were no calls or texts from him. I desperately tried to understand what was happening, unable to accept the reality I had so fervently sought. Like a lost puppy, I yearned for his attention. Eventually, I decided to call him again, hoping for an explanation. The phone rang several times, and when a voice finally answered, it was not his. It was a woman's voice, and I stammered, shocked by the unexpected response.</p>
</div> 
            <div class="container"><p class="listing"> I explained who I was waiting to speak with, only to hear the woman on the other end say, "I don't know who you're talking about. There's no one by that name." My heart sank, and I checked the number on my phone repeatedly, each time confirming it was correct. Conflicted and confused, I made repeated calls, each time greeted by the same unfamiliar voice. I decided to wait and confront the situation face-to-face.
                As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, the absence of the man I had fallen for weighed heavily on my heart. Doubt and confusion clouded my mind, leaving me to question the very existence of our connection. Had he ever truly been real, or was he a figment of my imagination?
                Desperate for answers, I confided in my closest friends, describing every detail I could recall about him. But to my surprise, they did not know the person I spoke of. Their confusion mirrored my own, deepening the mystery surrounding the man I had come to know so intimately.
                Haunted by the memories of our late-night conversations and the laughter we shared, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something had gone wrong. With each passing day, my yearning for him grew stronger, driving me to seek closure and find out the truth.</p>
</div>
           <div class="container"><p class="listing">The day of the confrontation arrived. I mustered up my courage and approached the lecture hall, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. But as I scanned the room, my heart sank. He was nowhere to be found. It seemed as though he had vanished into thin air, leaving behind only fading memories and unanswered questions.
            Unable to bear the weight of uncertainty any longer, I turned to my phone, dialling his number once more. The familiar ringtone filled my ears, but this time, it was not his voice that answered. Instead, a woman's voice echoed through the phone, claiming no knowledge of the man I sought.
            Confusion consumed me. Had I been deceived? Was this some cruel joke? I checked the number repeatedly, desperately hoping for an explanation. Yet, each time I dialled, the same voice responded, denying any connection to the man who had captured my heart.</p>
</div> 
            
           <div class="container"><p class="listing"> As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months once again, I found myself trapped in a disorienting limbo. My mind wandered between reality and illusion, desperately grasping for answers that remained frustratingly out of reach. The pain of loss mingled with the lingering hope that the truth would reveal itself one day.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="container"><p class="listing">In the depths of my confusion, I sought solace in the memories we had shared. Were those stolen moments mere illusions, or had we shared something real? The emotions I had felt, the laughter we had shared—they couldn't simply be figments of my imagination, could they?</p>
           </div>
          <div class="container"><p class="listing">Determined to find closure, I delved into my memories, retracing every interaction, every word exchanged. The more I searched, the more certain I became that our connection had been genuine. I refused to believe that it had all been a lie, a fabrication of my mind.
        </p></div> 
          <div class="container"><p class="listing">In my pursuit of truth, I sought out anyone who may have known him. I scoured social media, reached out to mutual acquaintances, and even visited places we had frequented together. Yet, at every turn, I was met with blank stares and confusion, as if the man I had fallen for had been erased from existence.</p>
          </div> 
           <div class="container"><p class="listing">As time passed, I reluctantly began to accept that I may never find the answers I sought. The pain of loss dulled, but the memory of him remained etched in my heart. I learned to cherish the moments we had shared, whether real or imagined, as they had shaped me in ways I couldn't ignore.
            Though the wounds of my unrequited love still lingered, I emerged from the experience with a newfound strength. I vowed to cherish myself, to guard my heart against illusions, and to trust my instincts more fiercely than ever before. It felt like I'd fail myself for I had once again fallen for another illusion.
