        <p class="title">CURSE OF THE BEADS</p>
        <p class="short"><i>Short Story</i></p>
 
           <div class="container"><p class="listing">The mother sat comfortably on a wooden stool with her precious little one nestled in her arms. She carefully cradled the baby with one hand and used the other to adorn her with a string of gleaming yellow and black beads. As she worked, she gently placed the baby on her lap, lying on her back, and began to delicately place each bead onto the baby's waist, calf, and arms.
            The beads themselves were nothing short of exquisite. Each one was intricately designed with black markings that contrasted beautifully with the bright yellow hue. As the mother worked, the beads seemed to come alive, casting a warm glow on the baby's already rosy cheeks. She placed them on the baby’s waist, arms and ankles.
            The mother couldn't help but marvel at how stunning her baby looked with the beads adorning her tiny frame. She couldn't believe that her baby would soon outgrow this special accessory, but for now, the baby looked like royalty in her mother's eyes. "My baby looks amazing," she whispered to herself, a proud smile spreading across her face.
        </p></div> 
           <div class="container"><p class="listing">The child continues to wear the bead each time being showered with her mother’s praises, day by day, year by year. With no day to take a break from wearing them. Her mother has gone mad and begins to worship the beads on her daughter’s waist, refusing her food so she doesn’t grow out of it. She would wait in front of the gates at her daughter’s school just to ensure her goddess wasn’t eating anything apart from what she gave her.
            At home, she would call her daughter to sit on her lap and would proceed to breastfeed her, singing her songs of praise and telling her never to leave her side at which the little girl nods her head while sucking on her mother’s breast.
            She grew thin almost making it look like there was no skin or her bones, soon the villagers realized the child had been wearing the same beads for years when she had to partake in (Dipo) their puberty rite. She could bearly carry her weight. They begin to slowly notice the mother's obsessive nature, causing them to separate the mother from the child. 
            The mother who could not bear living without her god, woke up one faithful morning, decided to wear her best clothes, walked to the centre of the town market and proceeded to cut her throat cursing the town forever with her last words. “ Mogya ni owuo na aba no” and her liguring ghost which would forever remain a captive in the market.
        </p></div> 
            <div class="container"><p class="listing">The child was forced to live with her aunt in the next village and was told nothing of her mother’s passing. They tried several times to rid her of the beads but all attempts proved to be futile. She would scream as if she felt the pain of the beads, crying and shaking profusely every time an attempt was made to rid her f her bead.
                Soon the aunt began to show the same signs as her mother, sitting her on her lap and breastfeeding her, singing her songs of praises while she bathed her, the feeling was too familiar to her. Not soon after the aunt began to worship her beads, going down on her knees every day to pray to them. It seemed as though her husband and kids couldn’t relate to the sovereign power she felt.
               Little by little she began to pull away from her family, refusing to cook or do any wifely duties. News spread across the towns about her behaviour and sparked a new era of gossip in every corner of the village. Ignoring them and even the complaints of her family.
            </p></div>
           <div class="container"> <p class="listing">The aunt woke up from her sleep one night, with voices invading her thoughts, the voices were clear to her, but no one knew what exactly she heard.” Mogya ni Owuo na aba no” was the phrase many believed she heard.
            She went to the kitchen grabbed a knife and sliced the throats of her 9-year-old son and six-year-old daughter, no sound was made or heard, walking back to her room her husband heard her footsteps and woke up to find his wife standing next to the bed in her bloody gown. He later stood on his feet watching his wife slit her throat, right after she says the words “Now we can all live in paradise”.
        </p></div>
           <div class="container"><p class="listing">The husband gathered himself and rushed to see the corpses of his children piled up on the floor in a sadistic manner. With him feeling so much grief in just one night, he goes on to the bedroom, takes the knife his wife used and pans to the girl’s room, stabbing her countless times, each time feeling less guilty and more pleasurable. He continued to stab her even when there seemed to be no life in her, it’s almost like he enjoyed it. He cuts off the beads and starts making his way out of the house. By morning, he had gotten to the market square, his clothes still stained from the blood of his family and some could notice little pieces of flesh from the girl’s wounds on his shirt.
            He stood in the centre of the market with the beads in one hand and the knife in the other. He raised the beads into the air pointing straight to the heavens, he smiled at the crowd, and slowly cut his throat staring closely at them and gushing out blood from his mouth as he continued.
            The village was yet again cursed. A priest emerges from the crown and takes the beads from the corpse, exits the market and proceeds to hand it to a town woman who just gave birth. The mother thanked him and we can see the same look both women had…
